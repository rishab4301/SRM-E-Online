				<h2>HISTORY OF GIVING GIFTS</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="heading-content">
				<p>
					Gift giving has been a long tradition that dates back thousands of
					years as far back as man can remember. As human beings, we are social
					creatures who enjoy each other’s company and expressing our feelings
					through the giving of gifts. Whether it is an expression of true love,
					appreciation of a job well done or just to show our gratitude for
					having someone as a friend, the giving of gifts is engrained into our
					DNA.<br /><br />The giving of gifts may be one of the oldest of human
					activities that pre-dates civilization and may go back to the origin
					of our species. Even in primitive cavemen culture, the giving of gifts
					was fairly common as it was used to show love and affection towards
					one another. The bestowing of gifts was also inferred as a status
					symbol when leaders of tribes or clans would show their appreciation
					for the contributions of those who were part of an important
					achievement. At Gifts Ready To Go, you will find many gifts ideas to
					help you find the perfect gift for any occasion and connect with
					people around you.<br /><br />Whether it was an unusually shaped rock,
					a tooth from an animal, the bark from a tree or some other item that
					was natural in origin, the giving of gifts was certainly common
					behavior long before we became an advanced civilization. As tools were
					developed, the gifts started to become more elaborate, for example
					holes were drilled into animal teeth and stones so they could be
					displayed on necklaces and many other objects were fashioned as
					well.<br /><br />Later during the Egyptian era, gifts were most
					notably given to their pharaohs who built massive pyramids to store
					their wealth for afterlife and produced idols to support their beliefs
					of idol worship. In Roman times people would present each other with
					good luck tokens, which lasted for centuries and later influenced all
					of Western civilization onwards. Such tokens of good luck were used as
					presents to carry favors and show allegiance, which is still the case
					today.<br /><br />By the Medieval age, gifts were used to secure the
					personal favor of the king or show allegiance in times of war. Also,
					personal gifts of betrothals were given as dowries which ranged from
					coins to precious metals to a herd of cattle, goats or sheep. In many
					cultures, dowries and other similar expressions still exist today.<br /><br />Today
					gift giving is still part of our everyday culture and defines who we
					are and the message we want to send with our gift. Gifts are given for
					all occasions and celebrations and are a means of us communicating
					with each other and expressing ourselves.<br />

				<h2 data-aos="fade">A History of Corporate Gifts Giving</h2>
				<p>
					The Corporate Advertising & Premium Gifts industry in Singapore was
					first established in the mid-1950s. In those early days, the practice
					was initiated by larger, more established companies as a form of
					appreciation to loyal, faithful clients and customers. Gift giving was
					limited largely to diaries, note pads, pens, key chains and wines.
					Today, the range of corporate gifts in the gift giving market is
					limited only by one’s imagination. The uniqueness of individual
					corporate gifts is a likely measure of the degree of closeness of the
					client’s relationship with the sender.
				</p>
				<h3>What is Corporate Gifting?</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					Corporate gifting is the practice of creating a touchpoint with
					employees, clients, or prospects through the use of a gift -such as a
					practical swag piece, an edible treat, or personalized clothing item
					or an experience (such as airfare or concert tickets).
				</p>
				<h3>Why is Corporate Gifting Important?</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					Receiving a gift is a powerful experience; it creates a sense of
					connection to the giver and can create positive associations with a
					person or a brand. Companies and marketers have long relied on the
					power of gifting to secure better relationships with potential and
					existing clients, to show appreciation for their business When used as
					part of your overall marketing or employee retention efforts, gifting
					can be highly effective in terms of ROI and satisfaction.
				</p>
				<h3>The Psychology of Corporate Gifts</h3>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					The effectiveness of gift-giving has a strong correlation to its
					psychological impact on the recipient. If you’ve ever gotten an
					unexpected surprise or treat (either in person or by direct mail)
					you’ve personally experienced this phenomenon in action. This is
					partly because physical contact with a gift results in the Endowment
					effect—a sense of ownership over an item which translates into an
					individual valuing it more highly, according to a study on the effects
					of gifting on business outcomes. It also influences feelings of
					reciprocity and trust. This effect can be seen in the results of
					marketing and gift-giving in several common scenarios of corporate
					gifting.
				</p>
				<h4>For Prospects</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					Gifting can motivate those who are not yet your customers to become
					one. In fact, 80% of consumers say they are more likely to do business
					with a company if it offers personalized experiences, according to
					Instapage. Sending the right gift at the right time can be the
					motivator for prospects to take a desired action, such as completing a
					purchase, signing up for a service, or making a discovery call.
				</p>
				<h4>For Clients</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					Clients too can benefit from a well-timed gift. It can let them know
					their business is valued, encourage them to continue their service or
					become brand evangelists, and has the power to bring your company back
					to top-of-mind in cases where it’s been a while since the last
					interaction. According to a retail study, consumers with an emotional
					connection to a brand have a 306% higher lifetime value.
				</p>
				<h4>For Employees</h4>
				<p data-aos="fade">
					Clients and prospects aren’t the only people businesses need to
					consider. In many cases, the key to great customer outcomes starts
					much closer to home. In fact, a study reports that 57% of people claim
					that receiving mail makes them feel more valued. This statistic
					relates to direct mail gifts; however, if you’ve ever been the
					recipient of some nicely-branded, high-quality apparel you know it can
					work for your staff as well.<br /><br />These gifts, especially when
					they are of good quality and well-personalized, create a feeling of
					being valued by your employer and foster a sense of belonging and
					connection to the team. These feelings translate into the way
					employees go about their roles, and the quality of service they
					provide to external stakeholders, customers, and prospects.
